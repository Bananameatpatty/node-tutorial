In node js 
- synchronous code = blocking code
- async. code  = non blocking 
where in asynv we can just run the heavy code in the backgroud making easier to implement programs to run first

A nodejs process is single threaded
so each application has only one thread

we have call backs in this 
becasue we will have to call back the background running process to the front

so callbacks != asynchronous 

to callback hell 
we will use promises and async/wait
